What I found most interesting about that article was its take on **"Choice."**
They found that too much choice in development was leading coders to work slower and less efficiently.
I also found it interesting how much of an impact **workflow** had on their productivity.
At the end of the day, they found that: **too many choices hurt development, inefficient workflows hurt development, and unnecessary features hurt output.**
